## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
a <- c(2, 3, 5)
b <- c(4,-1, 3)
```
```{r}
a+b
a-b
a*b
a/b
```

```{r}
a%%2
b%%2
```

```{r}
paste0(
  c("他叫","我叫"), c("小明","小美","大雄")
)
```
```{r}
example <- list(
  name=c("小明","小花","小新","美美"),
  height=c(175,166,170,160),

```

```{r}

example$height
c(175, 166, 170, 160) >= 170

example$name[pick_above170]
```
